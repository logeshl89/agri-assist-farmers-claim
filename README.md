# **Login & Register System (React & TypeScript)**

This project is a simple **Login and Registration System** built using **React** and **TypeScript**. It provides a user-friendly interface to simulate user authentication with basic form validation and error handling. The project is ideal for understanding how to manage state, handle form submissions, and structure components in a React TypeScript environment.

## **Features**

- **Login Form**:
  - Users can input their email and password to log in.
  - Includes basic validation for input fields (e.g., checking if the email is correct and password matches).
  - Displays an error message if login credentials are incorrect.
  - Optionally triggers a callback function (`onLoginSuccess`) after successful login.

- **Registration Form**:
  - Users can sign up by providing their username, email, password, and confirm password.
  - Includes validation to ensure that the password and confirm password match.
  - Displays an error message if the passwords do not match or if any field is left empty.
  - Optionally triggers a callback function (`onRegisterSuccess`) after successful registration.

- **State Management**:
  - Managed using React's `useState` hook to store user input and errors.
  - Ensures real-time feedback and validation as users interact with the form.

- **TypeScript Integration**:
  - TypeScript is used for type safety and better development experience.
  - Props and states are strongly typed to prevent errors and improve code clarity.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to ensure code quality and avoid runtime errors.
- **CSS** (optional): You can customize the styling based on your needs.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/login-register-system.git
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies.

```bash
cd login-register-system
npm install
```

### **3. Run the Application**

Start the development server to view the app in your browser.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **How It Works**

1. **Login Form**:
   - The user enters their email and password.
   - On form submission, the app checks the entered credentials. If they match a predefined set (for example, email: `admin@admin.com` and password: `password`), the login is considered successful. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

2. **Registration Form**:
   - The user provides a username, email, password, and confirm password.
   - The app checks if the `password` matches the `confirmPassword` field.
   - If the passwords match and all required fields are filled, the user is successfully registered (simulated with a callback function).

## **Structure**

- **Login.tsx**: Contains the login form logic and structure, managing state for email, password, and error messages.
- **Register.tsx**: Contains the registration form logic and structure, managing state for username, email, password, confirmPassword, and error messages.
- **App.tsx**: Parent component that renders the `Login` and `Register` components and handles success callbacks.
